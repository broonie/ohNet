Installing Zapp Library
-----------------------

Having built the library:
	make

You can install it with:
	sudo make install

Install behaviour varies by platform:

Posix
-----

By default, zapp is installed in "/usr". Libraries go in "/usr/lib/zapp",
include files go in "/usr/include/zapp". Zapp also installs a pkg-config
file to "/usr/lib/pkgconfig/managed.zapp.pc" that can be used by .NET
applications to build referencing the Zapp libraries. There is no
pkg-config file for the native interface yet.

You can install to a different location like so:

	make install prefix=~/myzappinstall

This will install libraries to "~/myzappinstall/lib/zapp" and include files
to "~/myzappinstall/include/zapp".

Windows
-------

To install to "%PROGRAMFILES%\Zapp" do:

	make install

To install to a different location, do:

	make install installdir="C:\path\to\install\dir"

Nothing is installed to the registry or outside of the specified directory.
Applications building against Zapp must have their include and library
directories updated manually. Binaries go in "$installdir\lib", include
files go in "$installdir\include".
